# 👋 Hi, I'm Anish Kunda

**Software Development Engineer | Backend Developer**

I specialize in building reliable, scalable, and high-performance backend systems using Java and Spring Boot.  
My work focuses on clean architecture, efficient data handling, concurrency, low-level file I/O, and designing services that are easy to maintain and scale.

I enjoy solving complex engineering problems, optimizing performance, and building systems that behave predictably under load.
